## Key Requirements Extracted

- National report structures include institutional context, implementation status, and indicator-linked responses.
- Wetland monitoring outputs benefit from map-ready and site-level evidence attachments.

## NBMS Mapping

- Ramsar template pack remains runtime-configurable and now benefits from spatial registry integration.
- Spatial layers can be attached to report products and consumed in map workspace and exports.
- Programme operations can link monitoring scope to spatial units for wetland-oriented reporting.
