# Ramsar COP14 National Report Notes

## Target Reference
- Ramsar COP14 National Report format and guidance (Section I-IV structure with implementation indicator questions).

## Source Links Checked
- https://www.ramsar.org/news/notification-2021-9-national-reporting-and-2022-cop14
- https://www.ramsar.org/sites/default/files/documents/library/cop14_nr_format_e.docx
- https://www.ramsar.org/sites/default/files/documents/library/cop14_nr_guidelines_2022.docx

## Access Status in This Environment
- The above links currently resolve to site-level 404 responses from the Ramsar domain.
- Formal section structure details were used from available notification/search summaries:
  - Section 1: Institutional information
  - Section 2: Optional implementation indicators
  - Section 3: Optional Ramsar Site indicators
  - Section 4: Optional annex (national target context)

## NBMS Mapping Direction
- Ramsar pack should remain a runtime template pack (not hard-coded forms).
- Questions should support:
  - coded responses,
  - optional narrative per question,
  - links to NBMS indicators/programmes/evidence.
- QA and deterministic exports should mirror NR7 builder behavior.

## Follow-up
- Retrieve a stable, downloadable COP14 format source and attach it in this folder when available.
