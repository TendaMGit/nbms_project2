## Key Requirements Extracted

- "Enter once, reuse many times" architecture.
- Shared data assets should serve multiple MEA report outputs.
- Interoperable APIs and reusable template/report products are essential.

## NBMS Mapping

- Runtime template packs and report product framework remain modular.
- Spatial registry layers are reusable assets across NR7, Ramsar, and publication products.
- OGC + vector tile endpoints provide reusable geospatial outputs without report-specific duplication.
