# Spatial Sources (Phase 8)

This folder records external spatial sources used by `sync_spatial_sources`.

For each source we capture:
- source URL
- license/terms
- attribution
- date accessed
- checksum (SHA-256)
- how NBMS uses the layer

Default auto-download sources are:
- Natural Earth public-domain layers for admin boundaries and ecosystem proxy coverage.
- DFFE SAPAD public-release protected-area feed for South African protected areas.

Restricted sources (for example WDPA) are optional, token-gated, and disabled by default.
