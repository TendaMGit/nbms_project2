# GBF Indicator Repository Notes

## Source

- GBF Indicator Repository
- https://www.gbf-indicators.org/

## Key Requirements Extracted

- Indicator metadata should include methods, disaggregation expectations, and data source assumptions.
- National systems should support multiple method pathways (manual, statistical, spatial, connector-based).

## NBMS Mapping

- Indicator Method SDK includes spatial overlay, CSV aggregation, binary aggregation, and connector workflows.
- Spatial unit and layer metadata support consistent disaggregation implementation in indicator series/datapoints.
- API surfaces expose series + spatial context for map-driven readiness checks.
