      <h2>4. Rationale</h2>
      <p><p>Purpose of the indicator </p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">1. Ecosystem services are critical for the wellbeing of people and make important contributions 
to the economy. Examples include harvested wild species, pollination of crops, water purification by 
filtering and regulating water quality, climate regulation by sequestering carbon dioxide, influencing 
local and global climate patterns, nature-based recreation and many more. Conserving, managing 
and sustaining ecosystems and biodiversity is fundamental to maintaining and enhancing ecosystem 
services. </p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">2. This indicator aims to track trends in the provision of ecosystem services, responding to the 
wording in Goal B that ecosystem services should be “maintained and enhanced, with those currently 
in decline being restored”. The index is intended to show whether the provision of ecosystem services 
is, on average, increasing, stable or decreasing, as well as the rate of these increases or decreases. 
Together with ecosystem-related headline indicators for Goal A (A1 Red List of ecosystems and A2 
Extent of natural ecosystems), indicator B1 provides insight into changes in the state and trends of 
ecosystems and the services they provide. </p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">3. The index of change in ecosystem services has the potential to be disaggregated in several 
ways, including by different categories of ecosystem service and by ecosystem type. As described 
further in Section 5, ecosystem services can be divided at a broad level into provisioning, regulating 
and cultural services, often with differing directions of change. Three sub-indices, one for each broad 
category of ecosystem services, will illuminate these differences. Combined with information from 
Indicators A1 and A2, disaggregation of the overall index by ecosystem type could provide valuable 
information to direct conservation, management and restoration efforts to enhance ecosystem service 
provision. </p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">4. Because the primary purpose of monitoring and reporting on headline indicators is to support 
Parties in their national implementation of the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal Global 
Biodiversity Framework, the indicator is designed to enable countries to select ecosystem services 
that they consider important and policy relevant to be included in the indicator, based on guidelines 
within this metadata document and supporting compilation guidelines (to be developed). The 
indicator also reflects ecosystem services that are of global relevance and that will be included in the 
indicator by all countries. Global aggregation of the indicator will provide a view of global progress towards maintaining, enhancing and restoring ecosystem services. The intended audience of the 
headline indicator is broad, reflecting the whole-of-society approach of the GBF. </p><p><strong>An accounting approach to the indicator </strong></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="redactor-invisible-space">5. The System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) Ecosystem Accounting, as the 
adopted international statistical standard for organizing data about ecosystem assets and services and 
linking this information to economic and other human activity, provides the conceptual framework 
and part of the methodology for the compilation of this indicator. SEEA Ecosystem Accounting is 
aligned with the System of National Accounts (SNA), which underpins the development of economic 
statistics such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), to illuminate the relationship between the 
environment and the economy, highlighting the contribution of ecosystems to the economy. </span></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="redactor-invisible-space">
6. Flows of ecosystem services in SEEA Ecosystem Accounting describe the contributions that 
ecosystems make to benefits used in economic and other human activity, which are a central part of 
describing nature’s contribution to people. Ecosystem services accounts should reflect both the 
supply of ecosystem services by different ecosystem types and the use of ecosystem services by 
different types of users, such as businesses, government and households. SEEA Ecosystem 
Accounting requires accounting for ecosystem services in biophysical terms, with the option of 
building on the biophysical accounts to develop accounts in monetary terms. Because accounting 
tables have a standard structure and are based on standard definitions and classifications, they allow 
for comparison across time periods and between countries. This makes an accounting approach a 
powerful basis for the development of national and global indicators. An additional strength of the 
accounting approach is that accounts provide granular information that can be used for local 
application and fine-grained policy decisions as well as aggregate information for national and global 
reporting.</span></p><p><strong><span class="redactor-invisible-space">Considerations for selection of ecosystem services for inclusion in the indicator </span></strong></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><span class="redactor-invisible-space">7. There are several considerations about the types of ecosystem services and their beneficiaries 
that should inform the selection of ecosystem services for the indicator at the national level. These 
include: </span></span></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><span class="redactor-invisible-space">(a) Whether people in vulnerable situations (such as low-income households, children 
and youth, women and girls, indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, among others) 
depend on the ecosystem service. Parties are encouraged to include such ecosystem services 
in their selection of ecosystem services for the indicator acknowledging that worldwide there 
is unequal access to ecosystem services by different social groups. This consideration is also 
significant for Target 9 (“<em>providing social, economic and environmental benefits for people, 
especially those in vulnerable situations and those most dependent on biodiversity</em>”), for 
which this indicator will contribute information. </span></span></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><span class="redactor-invisible-space">(b) Whether the ecosystem service is significant for indigenous peoples and local 
communities. Parties are encouraged to include such ecosystem services in their selection of 
ecosystem services for this indicator, with special attention to services that are necessary for 
the maintenance of cultural integrity and livelihoods. The selection of ecosystem services 
should recognize and consider multiple value perspectives on nature, including the diverse 
value systems and concepts embodied by indigenous peoples and local communities (IPBES, 
2022). </span></span></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><span class="redactor-invisible-space">(c) Whether it is possible to assess if provision of the ecosystem service is sustainable 
or not. Goal B emphasises that ecosystem services should support sustainable development 
for the benefit of current and future generations. Some (not all) ecosystem services can be 
used above their regeneration or absorption rate, with a negative impact on the capacity of 
the ecosystem to generate such services in the future. In such cases, the current use of the 
ecosystem service is not sustainable and does not support sustainable development. Ideally 
the indicator would distinguish between sustainable and unsustainable current use of ecosystem services. In practice it is often difficult to identify when the current use of an 
ecosystem service has crossed a sustainability threshold, but where possible Parties will be 
encouraged to flag ecosystem services where sustainability thresholds may have been 
crossed. Nevertheless, it is likely to be challenging to address this aspect fully in the 
indicator. </span></span></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><span class="redactor-invisible-space">(d) Whether the ecosystem service is provided by natural, semi-natural or anthropogenic 
ecosystem type(s). Ecosystem services from natural and semi-natural ecosystems are well-suited to this indicator. Provisioning ecosystem services from intensively modified or 
anthropogenic ecosystem types such as croplands and plantations should be approached with 
caution in selecting ecosystem services for this indicator, for several reasons. First, 
conversion of natural ecosystems to intensively modified or anthropogenic ecosystems is one 
of the main threats to biodiversity, so increases in the provision of these ecosystem services 
is frequently associated with biodiversity loss. Second, it is often difficult to tease out the 
contribution of the ecosystem from the contributions of produced capital and labour to 
provision of these services, making it difficult to quantify the ecosystem service as distinct 
from the total harvested biomass. Finally, these ecosystem services are often captured in 
accounting frameworks outside of ecosystem accounts (such as the System of National 
Accounts and its associated mainstream economic indicators), so are not “<em>hidden</em>” but rather 
already accounted for in standard economic measures.</span></span></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><span class="redactor-invisible-space">8. In selecting ecosystem services to include in the indicator, Parties are encouraged to take into 
account data available and to consider the alignment and compatibility of the ecosystem service with 
the overall intent of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. It is also important to 
consider the monitoring framework for the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework as a 
whole, with different indicators giving information about different aspects. In particular, indicators 
A1 (Red List of Ecosystems), A2 (Extent of natural ecosystems) and B1 should be considered 
together as a suite of indicators related to ecosystems. Indicator A1 captures information about risks 
to ecosystems, including as a result of decline in their condition, while indicator A2 captures 
information about the abundance of natural and semi-natural ecosystems relative to anthropogenic 
ecosystems. </span></span></span></p></p>

        <h2>5. Definitions, concepts and classifications</h2>
        <h3>5a. Definition</h3>
        <p><p>9. The proposed indicator is defined as the average rate of change in the provision of a set of 
ecosystem services in a particular time period compared to a baseline year, for a country or globally. </p><p>
10. The concepts, definitions and classifications used in this indicator are based on the SEEA 
Ecosystem Accounting statistical standard that was adopted by the United Nations Statistical 
Commission in March 2021.12 Ecosystem services are defined as the contributions of ecosystems to 
the benefits that are used in economic and other human activity, while benefits are defined as the 
goods and services that are ultimately used and enjoyed by people and society. For accounting 
purposes, the focus is usually on final ecosystem services only, which are those ecosystem services 
in which the user of the service is an economic unit (i.e. business, government or household).</p><p>11. In ecosystem accounting, ecosystem services are conceptualised as flows between ecosystem 
assets and economic units. This results in an alignment between supply and use (i.e. supply needs to 
match use of a particular service), which is a foundational accounting concept. This means that an 
ecosystem service is recorded in the tables only when it is used. Explained differently, ecosystem 
services must actually be used to be included in the account, while ecosystem services that could 
potentially be used are excluded. For the purpose of this indicator the terms <em>“supply of ecosystem 
services</em>” and “<em>ecosystem service supply</em>” are avoided as they do not capture the use aspect of 
ecosystem services. Rather, the terms ecosystem service provision or provision of ecosystem services 
are used, with the intention of capturing the combination of supply and use that characterises ecosystem services in an accounting context. The account table follows a standard structure, shown 
in Table 7.1 of SEEA Ecosystem Accounting. </p><p>12. The total area for which the accounts are compiled is called the ecosystem accounting area. 
For the purposes of this indicator, the ecosystem accounting area should be the total area of the 
country. For countries that have marine territory, the total surface area of the country could be divided 
into separate ecosystem accounting areas, for example one for the land and inland water area and 
another for the territorial waters (sea area to the end of the exclusive economic zone). Further 
guidance on this will be provided in compilation guidelines to be developed. </p><p>13. Ecosystem services are commonly grouped as provisioning, regulating and maintenance, and 
cultural services. SEEA Ecosystem Accounting includes a reference list of ecosystem services, 
grouped according to these broad categories, which has been adopted as part of the SEEA Ecosystem 
Accounting international statistical standard. There was detailed and extensive consultation on the 
development of this reference list and cross walks exist with all other major ecosystem services 
classifications. Within provisioning services, the SEEA Ecosystem Accounting reference list 
identifies ten sub-types of ecosystem services; within regulating services there are sixteen sub-types; 
and within cultural services there are five sub-types. </p><p>14. SEEA Ecosystem Accounting uses the IUCN’s Global Ecosystem Typology as the reference 
classification for ecosystem types, which was also endorsed by the United Nations Statistical 
Commission at its 55th session in March 2024 as an international statistical classification and 
recommended it to be included in the international family of classifications. Parties are able to use 
their national ecosystem classifications as the basis for their ecosystem accounts and ideally to cross-walk national ecosystem types to the Ecosystem Functional Groups (Level 3) of the Global 
Ecosystem Typology. </p><p>15. The biophysical ecosystem services accounts describe the flows of ecosystem services 
provided by ecosystem assets, grouped according to ecosystem type, in volume terms per accounting 
period. Metrics from the accounts are commonly in physical units such as cubic meters or tonnes. 
Indicators that can be derived from the account tables include percentage change over an accounting 
period or with respect to a baseline period. </p><p>16. The biophysical quantity for each ecosystem service may also be expressed in monetary terms 
where monetary valuation of the service is undertaken. Monetary valuation in an accounting context 
is approached differently to monetary valuation in environmental economics, and includes only 
exchange values rather than both exchange values and welfare values. The monetary ecosystem 
services accounts describe the ecosystem services provided by the ecosystem asset in monetary terms 
per accounting period, which can be aggregated to a single monetary value per accounting period. 
Indicators that can be derived from the account tables include percentage change in value over an 
accounting period or with respect to a baseline period.</p></p>

      <div class="content-to-pdf__sub-block">
        <h3>5b. Method of computation</h3>
        <p><p>17. The indicator is computed in three stages: 1) selection of ecosystem services for inclusion in 
the indicator, 2) compilation of ecosystem services accounts, and 3) calculation of an aggregate index 
based on information from the accounts.</p><p><em>Stage 1 Selection of ecosystem system services to be included <br></em></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">18. The first stage in computing the indicator is to select ecosystem services that will be included 
in the indicator. As described above, the SEEA Ecosystem Accounting reference list of ecosystem 
services is used as the basis for the indicator and should thus be used in the selection of ecosystem 
services to be included in the indicator.
19. The selection of ecosystem services for this indicator takes a blended approach, reflecting both 
national and global priorities, based on the rationale explained in Section 4. The following starting point is used as the basis for the selection of ecosystem services by Parties for inclusion in the 
indicator at the national level: </p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">(a) Required ecosystem services of global relevance to be included by all Parties (e.g. 
global climate regulation services (GCRS)). </p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">(b) Recommended ecosystem services to be included by Parties from the SEEA 
Ecosystem Accounting reference list of ecosystem services, such that there is a combination 
of provisioning services, regulating services and cultural services. Alongside the 
recommended ecosystem services, there may also be a list of ecosystem services that Parties 
are discouraged from selecting. </p><p style="margin-left: 40px;">(c) Parties may include additional ecosystem services that they consider important or 
policy relevant if they wish to.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="redactor-invisible-space">20. From the recommended ecosystem services, Parties should select services based on a 
combination of importance or policy relevance of the service and data availability. In the selection 
of ecosystem services Parties should also consider the alignment and compatibility of the ecosystem 
service with the overall intent of the GBF, including the factors raised in the rationale in Section 4 
related to dependence of people in vulnerable situations on the ecosystem service, its significance for 
indigenous peoples and local communities, whether it is possible to access if provision of the service 
is sustainable or not, whether the service is provided by anthropogenic ecosystem type(s) that impact 
negatively on biodiversity, the ease with which the contribution of the ecosystem to the service can 
be isolated and quantified, and the extent to which the service is already accounted for in standard 
economic measures. Relevance to Targets 9 and 11, for which ecosystem services accounts are also 
the basis for the headline indicator, should also be considered. </span></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="redactor-invisible-space">21. For the first reporting period, in 2026, countries should report on any and all ecosystem 
services they have data available for. Compilation guidelines will be developed to provide additional 
guidance on selection of ecosystem services for inclusion in the indicator, in subsequent reporting 
periods, including which services of global relevance are required to be included, the minimum 
number of services to be included per broad ecosystem service category, and more detail on factors 
to consider in the selection process.</span></p><p><em><span class="redactor-invisible-space">Stage 2 Compilation of ecosystem services accounts </span></em></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><span class="redactor-invisible-space">22. The second stage of developing the indicator is to compile accounts for each of the ecosystem 
services selected. The accounts should be compiled ideally at the national level, based on the SEEA 
Ecosystem Accounting. Methods for this are described in SEEA Ecosystem Accounting, with some 
supporting material already available (for example, SEEA e-learning resources | System of 
Environmental Economic Accounting) and more in development. For an example of an ecosystem 
services accounting table, see Table 7.1 in SEEA Ecosystem Accounting. </span></span></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><span class="redactor-invisible-space">23. There may be some iteration between selection of ecosystem services and compilation of the 
accounts, as data needs and data availability for specific ecosystem services are determined.</span></span></p><p><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><em><span class="redactor-invisible-space">Stage 3 Indicator calculation </span></em></span></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><span class="redactor-invisible-space">24. The third stage of developing the indicator involves taking information from the ecosystem 
services accounts to develop an aggregate index of change in ecosystem service provision. Since, in 
physical terms, each ecosystem service is measured in a different unit, a simple summation across 
ecosystem services is not possible. Hence, an indicator that would allow aggregation across 
ecosystem services needs to be developed. Several options were identified, including aggregation of 
trends (rates of change) in quantitative terms using an averaging method, semi-qualitative 
approaches, and aggregation in monetary terms. </span></span></span></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><span class="redactor-invisible-space">25. Based on initial exploration and testing experts converged that an aggregation method using a 
geometric mean of trends of ecosystem services seems to be the most viable option. The chain method 
for calculating the geometric mean has the advantage that it allows for different time series lengths with different starting years for different ecosystem services, which means that additional ecosystem 
services can be added to the index as datasets and accounts for additional ecosystem services become 
available. </span></span></span></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><span class="redactor-invisible-space">
26. In addition to a single aggregate index, three sub-indices, one for each broad category of 
ecosystem services (i.e. provisioning, regulating and cultural) should be calculated and reported. 
Because trends in provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services often move in different 
directions, which can be masked by the overall index, it will be important to present the overall index 
and the three sub-indices together, not just the overall index. Further guidance on the aggregation 
method and disaggregations will be provided in the compilation guidelines. </span></span></span></p><p style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><span class="redactor-invisible-space"><span class="redactor-invisible-space">27. In addition to the aggregate index in biophysical terms, aggregate measures of ecosystem 
services in monetary terms could be reported by Parties as a component or complementary indicator. 
If monetary ecosystem services accounts have been developed, aggregate measures in monetary 
terms can be derived by summing total supply or use for each ecosystem service for the same period, 
with care taken to use constant prices across accounting periods to ensure that the values are 
expressed in real rather than nominal terms. The monetary value of ecosystem services can be 
expressed as a percentage of gross value added (GVA) from the national (economic) accounts.</span></span></span></p></p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-to-pdf__sub-block">
        <h3>5c. Data collection method</h3>
        <p>28. The compilation of ecosystem services accounts should ideally be based on national timeseries datasets for ecosystem services, which could combine data from a range of sources to provide 
the best available estimates of ecosystem service supply and use. For many ecosystem services, some 
form of modelling is required to produce these estimates. If suitable national datasets are not available 
and cannot be developed with current resources, an alternative is to use available global datasets and 
models to develop initial estimates for the accounts, subject to criteria, standards and quality 
assurance. Validation by relevant national experts through appropriate institutional processes would 
be required to assess whether the results from global datasets and models are credible. Several global
tools are available, such as ARIES for SEEA, InVEST, ESTIMAP. In some cases, these global tools 
allow for the incorporation of national datasets and/or models. Further guidance for some ecosystem 
services is available in Guidelines on Biophysical Modelling for Ecosystem Accounting (United 
Nations 2021). In addition, a wealth of literature is available on measuring ecosystem services.
29. Data quality guidelines for this and other headline indicators should be addressed in 
compilation guidelines.</p>

compilation of ecosystem services accounts, and these differ depending on which ecosystem service 
is being measured. Data could be sourced from research institutions, various government ministries, 
national mapping agencies, national statistical offices, various government departments and other 
organs of state at the national or sub-national level (such as municipalities). Remote sensing and 
earth observation data play an important role for some ecosystem services.  </p></p>

        <p><p><span class="TextRun SCXW32148122 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW32148122 BCX0"></span></span></p>34. According to the Global Assessment of Environmental-Economic Accounting and Supporting 
Statistics (2023) undertaken by the UNSD, 22 countries compiled biophysical ecosystem services 
accounts at least once and 15 countries compiled monetary ecosystem services accounts at least once 
during the period 2019 to 2023. Ideally ecosystem services accounts would be compiled annually, 
but in practice few countries would have the capacity to do this, so accounting periods of three to 
five years are more likely<p>35. Global tools and databases to support ecosystem services accounting are currently under 
development (see Section 5c). </p><p><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW32148122 BCX0" style="background-color: initial;"></span></p></p>

countries. Time series for different ecosystem services accounts will differ. As ecosystem services 
accounts are developed at the national level, time series for different ecosystem services will depend 
on data availability, with back casting possible in some cases.
37. The proposed baseline year for global reporting under the GBF is likely to be 2020, or 
alternatively an average of the values between 2010 and 2020.Country baseline dates may be distinct 
from the global baseline data, depending on data available at the national level.<p><span class="TextRun SCXW246870007 BCX0"><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW246870007 BCX0"> </span></span></p></p>

temporal gaps (e.g. once-off datasets, very short time-series or interrupted time series), spatial gaps 
(e.g. data available only for some sub-regions or local areas within a country), or complete lack of 
data for some ecosystem services at the national or global level. </p><p>42. As noted in earlier sections, for some ecosystem services, missing values for individual 
countries may be estimated using ARIES for SEEA or other global modelling platforms based on existing global data, subject to criteria, standards and quality assurance including national validation 
through appropriate institutional processes involving relevant national experts.</p></p>

system). Countries will not be required to submit their ecosystem services account tables but rather 
to submit data extracted from the tables. Data in absolute terms is very useful, so the reporting 
template will require countries to report not only their overall index and three sub-indices but also 
absolute values for provision of each ecosystem service. Wherever possible, these absolute values 
should be disaggregated by ecosystem functional group, using the EFG codes and names from the 
GET. This will align this indicator with indicators A1 and A2 and will allow for global aggregation 
to ecosystem functional groups, biomes or realms as needed.<p>49. The reporting template will allow countries to submit data for all the accounting periods for 
which they have compiled accounts. As noted in Section 5g, the proposed baseline year for global 
reporting under the GBF is likely to be 2020, or alternatively an average of the values between 2010 
and 2020. Country baseline dates may be distinct from the global baseline data, depending on data 
available at the national level. Collecting data for years prior to the global baseline from countries 
that have such data could enable additional analyses that may be useful. </p>

It may be possible to disaggregate by type of user (business, households and government – the 
economic units typically included in ecosystem services accounts).
51. Subnational disaggregation may be important and useful at the country level (for example, 
disaggregation to provinces and municipalities). However, this would not be required for global data 
collection
52. Disaggregation related to indigenous peoples and local communities may be relevant for this 
indicator, if suitably granular data are available. However, this is a complex issue and guidance would 
need to be sought from the CBD’s Working Group on Article 8(j).<p><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW51778705 BCX0" style="background-color: initial;"></span></p></p>
