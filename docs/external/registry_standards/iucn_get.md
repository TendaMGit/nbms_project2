## NBMS mapping
- GET nodes are stored in `IucnGetNode`.
- Ecosystem mapping is represented with explicit crosswalk records (`EcosystemTypologyCrosswalk`) including:
  - confidence,
  - primary mapping flag,
  - evidence,
  - reviewer status.
- Automatic full crosswalk is intentionally avoided; review workflow is mandatory.
