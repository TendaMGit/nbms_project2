## Branch Deletion Plan

- Executed:
  - Kept all open-PR head branches (Dependabot set) because their PRs are still open.
  - Deleted only merged/closed PR head branches after creating archive tags.
  - Excluded protected/default branches (`main`, `master`, `develop`, `release/*`, `production`, `hotfix/*`).
- Repository setting recommendation:
  - Enable **Settings → General → Pull Requests → Automatically delete head branches**.
  - This setting was documented as a recommendation; it was not changed via automation in this run.

## Actions Taken

- Inventory captured and validated against GitHub state.
- Open PR triage complete:
  - Reviewed PRs #31-#54 (Dependabot update set).
  - All are mergeable but currently failing required checks (`FAILURE` present in status rollups).
  - Left open intentionally for dedicated dependency remediation/retest batching.
  - No open PR branches were deleted or closed in this cleanup pass.
- Remote cleanup completed:
  - Created `archive/<branch>/<YYYYMMDD>-<shortsha>` tags for each deleted remote branch.
  - Deleted 27 merged/closed remote branches.
- Local cleanup completed:
  - Switched to `main`, fast-forwarded from `origin/main`, pruned tracking refs.
  - Deleted all local branches already merged into `main` (excluding protected names).

## Follow-ups

- Dependency remediation pass for PRs #31-#54:
  - Rebase/check each branch against latest `main`.
  - Resolve CI failures.
  - Merge with squash + auto-delete after checks pass.
- Optional: after dependency PRs are merged/closed, repeat this cleanup to remove their branches.

## Post-Cleanup Verification

- `git status`: clean working tree on `main`
- Local branches: merged-into-main branches removed; only active/unmerged branches remain.
- Remote branches: merged/closed PR heads removed; open Dependabot PR heads retained.
- CI on `main` after cleanup commit:
  - `CI`: queued
  - `Migration Verification`: in progress
  - `CodeQL`: in progress
