# NEXT BACKLOG - NBMS Project 2

## Phase 1: Reference Catalog normalized registry + CRUD parity
- Complete normalized registry coverage for Frameworks, Goals, Targets, Indicators, Programmes, Datasets, Methodologies.
- Ensure metadata parity (source refs, QA status, sensitivity, provenance, links) across UI + import/export.
- Align list/detail/edit views and permissions for all registry entities.

## Phase 2: Alignment UI expansion + readiness/validation
- Expand alignment UI for target/indicator mappings (bulk actions, coverage diagnostics).
- Add validation checks for cross-framework integrity and completeness readiness.
- Surface readiness signals in review dashboard and export readiness panels.

## Phase 3: Pilot extraction strategy (from nbms_project)
- Define extraction scope: data models only (no legacy schema import), focus on registry + mappings + indicator data.
- Build a mapping plan for identifiers, provenance, and consent flags.
- Document migration/import steps and acceptance criteria for each dataset.

## Phase 4: Demo seed plan (end-to-end walkthrough)
- Design deterministic seed datasets for reporting cycle, instance, approvals, and review pack.
- Define scripts/fixtures and expected outputs (review pack v2 + ORT NR7 v2 export).
- Document reset/seed order and verification checks (no implementation yet).
